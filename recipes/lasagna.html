    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      If you're planning to freeze lasagna, it's best to cook it in a foil
      baking dish. Allow the casserole to cool, then cover the whole thing in at
      least one layer of storage wrap. Wrap it again in aluminum foil to prevent
      freezer burn. Freeze for up to three months.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short
      on time, but be aware that it will change the texture of the noodles. The
      best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers with
      foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's
      heated through and the sauce is bubbly.
